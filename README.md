Android Support Library
=======================

This package provides the support jar for backwards compatibility, so that other plugins can depend on it without having conflicts.
See [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html).


This avoids errors such as 

	[Error: Uh oh!
	"myapp/platforms/android/libs/android-support-v13.jar" already exists!]
